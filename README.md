Description of Deeque.py
To run the Deque program, you have to have the python virtual environment on your pc. It would be best if you also had NumPy and array libraries on your pc. You can successfully run the deque.py
Description of Binary_search_recurse.py
To run this python program, you must have a python environment installed on your computer. You must also have the array, random, math, time, and Merge_sort modules on your pc.
For this reason, merge_sort.py would be added as a separate python file. To run this program, store the Merge_sort.py in the same directory as the Binary_search_recurse.py.
Comparative Analysis
After creating the table to compare the execution times of both the binary search and the Interpolation search. The results show that;
When the size of the array is 100 interpolation search though the sequence is faster than using a binary search.
When the array size is 1000, interpolation still is better than using a binary search.
However, when we get to a sequence of 5000, the interpolation search tends to use more time than the binary search
In all these cases the target was not in the array, but when the target is present in the array, the interpolation search is the best searching tool over the binary search. This is because the interpolation search has a runtime of O(log(log n)).
